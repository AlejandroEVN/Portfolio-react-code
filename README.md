### Portfolio
This is the code of my portfolio website.  
The website was entirely designed and coded by myself using JavaScript, ReactJS and vanilla CSS3. This is the first website I create with the React framework. Albeit having good experience with JavaScript, this project allowed me to further improve those skills and learn JSX syntax and React.
I have created custom hooks that used them for the theme and menu elements.

All the images used in the website are free to use.
